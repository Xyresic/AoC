input: 51hp, 9 dmg
part one: 900 (Recharge, Poison, Shield, Magic Missiles, Poison, Magic Missiles, Magic Missiles, Magic Missiles)
part two: 1216 (Poison, Recharge, Shield, Poison, Recharge, Drain, Poison, Magic Missiles)

Poison is the most powerful damage spell, and shield the most powerful sustaining spell. Drain is pretty bad.
Impossible to deal enough damage and survive with 500 mana, so at least one recharge is necessary.
For part two, two recharges, two poisons, and one shield are abosultely necessary.
Start poisoning as early as possible to survive.
Poison deals 9 damage before the boss attacks again.
